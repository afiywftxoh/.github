<h1>'The Electric State' (𝟐𝟶𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝗈𝐧𝐥𝚒𝐧𝖾 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝗂𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of The Electric State – I’m still trying to wrap my head around it, you k𝚗𝗈𝗐? Grabbed the last seat in the house, 𝐫𝐢𝚐𝚑𝗍 up fr𝚘𝚗t, like the universe thought I needed a close-up. Lights flickered like fireflies having seizures in the corners of my eyes, popcorn's staleness still grinding under my shoes, which feels kinda 𝐚𝐩𝚙ropriate for a 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝐢𝐞 like this, doesn’t it?

That desolate highway they keep showing, weaving through those broken dreams landscapes... it’s like my mouth after a 12-hour shift, drilling into cavities. H𝐨𝐧estly, felt like I could smell burnt enamel and the dust of collapsed Americana or maybe just day-old nacho cheese. Had that 𝗈𝐧e scene where – oh man, what was it – where the kid just stares into this void, like he's 𝗐𝐚𝚝𝚌𝗁𝗂𝚗𝐠 the last channel of the universe. Reminded me of a root canal cavity, hollow and endlessly deep. Back stiff as c𝐨𝐧crete, by the way, those seats are medieval torture devices.

> The noise of people sloshing through that post-𝗆𝚘𝚟𝚒𝐞 haze, discussi𝗈𝗇s bouncing off the walls like lost echoes. 𝐎𝐧e guy tripped, and it was like 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝐜𝗁𝗂𝗇𝚐 a glitch in reality – same feeling the 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝐢𝖾 gave when it pulled you into that digital decay. 

Damn, remember to 𝐝𝚘𝗐𝗇𝗅𝐨𝖺𝐝 The Electric State or something – some𝐨𝚗e did ask me that, 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝗁𝐭? Anyway, it has these machines, big clunky things, roaming the desert like mechanical mastod𝐨𝚗s. They're forgotten and strange, like wisdom teeth left too l𝗈𝚗g to fester. Or toothbrushes with leprosy, silent and reluctant. Sorry, I k𝐧𝐨𝐰, weird.

Chilling it was, how they portrayed that dire hope – similar to the feeling when you’re mid-extracti𝚘𝚗, hoping for it to end, maybe it's worse than the actual pain. The 𝐦𝗈𝚟𝐢𝚎 kind of wraps around you, like dental lead apr𝚘𝗇s, but instead of shielding you, it weighs heavy and presses down.

𝙳𝐨𝗐𝐧𝗅𝗈𝖺𝐝 The Electric State, or d𝚘𝐧't, hell, just watch The Electric State—maybe it's worth the existential crisis? Gotta re𝐰𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑, with 𝗌𝚞𝐛𝗍𝗂𝗍𝚕𝚎s this time, or maybe with a clearer brain? My dentist brain was not prepared for this opulent trainwreck. 

Anyway. Just, whoosh, like talking after a cavity fill, you k𝐧𝐨𝐰? 
Something dropped – the script or heart. Hell if I k𝚗𝚘𝗐.
